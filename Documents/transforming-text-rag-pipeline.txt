In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. In this project, I developed a comprehensive RAG pipeline that leverages LLaMA 2, Pinecone, and LangChain to enable intelligent question-answering over PDF documents.

🔍 Project Overview
The goal was to create a system that can ingest PDF documents, process and store their content efficiently, and provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries. This involved several key components:

PDF Parsing: Utilized PyMuPDF to extract text from PDF files.

Text Chunking and Embedding: Employed sentence-transformers to divide the text into manageable chunks and generate embeddings.

Vector Storage: Stored embeddings in Pinecone, facilitating efficient similarity searches.

Language Model Integration: Integrated LLaMA 2 (13B) using Hugging Face Transformers for generating responses.

Query Handling: Implemented LangChain's RetrievalQA to manage user queries and retrieve relevant information.

🧠 Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Tools:
PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
sentence-transformers for embedding generation
Pinecone for vector storage and similarity search
LangChain for orchestrating the retrieval and generation process
Hugging Face Transformers for integrating LLaMA 2

🚀 Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges was ensuring the relevance and accuracy of responses generated by the language model. By integrating Pinecone for efficient similarity search and fine-tuning the chunking strategy, the system could retrieve more contextually relevant information, leading to more accurate answers.

📌 Future Work
Looking ahead, I plan to:

Incorporate support for additional document formats beyond PDFs.

Explore the integration of other language models to compare performance.

Implement a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
